This project is about learning. We will let people provide YouTube videos for the program to analyze its contents concerning propaganda, merchandising or any kind of plug. This will get people faster to the content that they want to consume, and it's being done through these steps:

1. Download the video captions (.srt) given a YouTube video URL.
2. Prepare the captions to be analyzed. 
3. Analyze the captions applying machine learning.
4. Return YouTube URL with time stamps.
